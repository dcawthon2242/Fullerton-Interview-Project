# Fullerton-Interview-Project

Project made for a Cal State Fullerton Data & Analytics position. Code was written with the intent of exploring the problems with the 2023 Fullerton team (pitching) and find areas that could be improved upon within pitcher decision making and development.

Cleaned 2023 trackman data to create a leaderboard, then used ggplot and linear models to explore correlations in the data between chase%, whiff%, EV, etc. and pitch characteristics/pitch usage.
